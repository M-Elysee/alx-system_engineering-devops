0x19. Postmortem

Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.


0. My first postmortem

Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

Requirements:

Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)
what was the root cause
Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:

when was the issue detected
how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained…)
actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
how the incident was resolved
Root cause and resolution must contain:
